# zkMonopoly
zkMonopoly is a solo blockchain game on the Horizen Gobi Testnet. Start with 500 SMONO tokens, and roll dice to move around a virtual board. Landing on tiles can earn (PROFIT) or deduct (LOSS) SMONO tokens. Once you collect 1000 SMONO, you can use a zkVerify API key to generate a zk proof, verify it, burn 1000 SMONO, and earn 1 XMONO point
